The following ActionScript 3 code attempts to access a property of an object that might be null or undefined:

```actionscript
var myObject:Object = someFunctionThatMightReturnNull();
trace(myObject.someProperty);
```

If `someFunctionThatMightReturnNull()` returns null or undefined, attempting to access `myObject.someProperty` will throw a `TypeError: Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference.`
